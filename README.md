# security-practice

A for fun project whose purpose is for practicing Spring Security. <br />
Ended up becoming a project to practice Spring Security but also a simple bank application.

# Technology Used
. MySQL<br />
. Spring Boot<br />
. Thymeleaf<br />
. JPA<br />
. Spring Security<br />

# Features
Allows users to create an account which also creates a bank account for them with a default value of $0.
<br />
After registering they are able to login and based on what role they possess get redirected to the corresponding page they should see.
<br />
Users will then be able to click a link to go to a new page to choose which transaction they wish to proceed perform.
<br />
The transaction will be stored in the database and then the user will be redirected back to their profile which will show their account information, username and amount in <br />
account only and then below that will list the transactions they performed.
